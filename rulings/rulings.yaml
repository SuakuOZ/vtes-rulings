# ## Design notes
#
# The core principle of this project is to provide a curated list of rulings
# **in a format that can withstand the passing of time**.
#
# We have lost countless ressources to the passing decades because they were hosted in unmaintained databases
# or in other impracticle formats.
# With hindsight, the most resilient formats are the simplest time-tested text-based standards.
# For example, the cards database, maintained in CSV format, or the TWD archive in plain HTML.
#
# Here, we have opted for YAML, because it offers a more flexible structure than CSV (multiple rulings per card),
# and is more readable than JSON, if anyone has to pick the project up without context in the future.
#
# ### Design principle
#
# **The rulings reference is a single self-sufficient YAML file. It is usable with a text editor, without processing.**
#
# ### Design details
#
# 1. The rulings can contain disciplines and card types symbols in brackets (eg. `[pot]`), see the list below
# 2. The rulings can contain card names in braces (eg. `{Abbot}`)
# 3. Each ruling ends with one or more rulings reference IDs in brackets.
#    References URLs are listed in the [references.yaml](rulings/references.yaml) file
# 4. Rulings are attached to a card, the format of the key is `<card_id>|<card_name>`, using the VEKN CSV cards IDs,
#    or to group of cards, using the `<id>|<name>` format, with an ID beginning with `G`. Cards groups are listed in
#    the [groups.yaml](rulings/groups.yaml) file.
#
# #### List of symbols
#
# - Inferior disciplines: abo, ani, aus, cel, chi, dai, dem, dom, for, mal, mel, myt, nec, obe, obf, obt, pot, pre, pro,
#   qui, san, ser, spi, str, tem, thn, tha, val, vic, vis
# - Superior disciplines: ABO, ANI, AUS, CEL, CHI, DAI, DEM, DOM, FOR, MAL, MEL, MYT, NEC, OBE, OBF, OBT, POT, PRE, PRO,
#   QUI, SAN, SER, SPI, STR, TEM, THN, THA, VAL, VIC, VIS
# - Virtues: vin, def, jus, inn, mar, ven, red
# - Card types: ACTION, POLITICAL, ALLY, RETAINER, EQUIPMENT, MODIFIER, REACTION, COMBAT, REFLEX, POWER
# - Other: FLIGHT, MERGED, CONVICTION
#
#  Note the "Vision" virtue uses the `[vsn]` trigram, to avoid confusion with the "Visceratika" discipline `[vis]`.
#  Some versions of the VEKN CSV do use `[vis]` for both indistinctively.
#
# ### Discarded options
#
# We discarded some options after careful consideration:
#
# 1. We could have used some **fields for the rulings** (separating symbol prefix, text, and references).
#    Although a proper API _should_ present the rulings structure this way, the reference file must be kept as simple
#    and readable as possible. The current structure _stays usable_ with very little post-treatment, which is better.
#    Producing an alternative, more structured version, of the rulings, could be done by automated parsing.
#
# 2. We could have used **cards IDs only** and not bother with the cards name, but this would make this reference file
#    unusable out of the box without the proper tooling. Such as it is, the file can be opened and a card searched for
#    by name with just a text editor.
#
# 3. The **cards names** are the ones used in the VEKN CSV reference file. We could have opted for other alternatives,
#    but we believe consistency with the existing reference is the stronger argument.
#    Note different versions of the same vampires share the same name with different IDs (advanced, higher group).

100001|.44 Magnum:
  - Provides only only maneuver each combat, even if the bearer changes.
  - The optional maneuver cannot be used if the strike cannot be used (eg. {Hidden Lurker}).
100002|419 Operation:
  - You can burn the edge to burn the card if it has no counter.
100003|Aaron's Feeding Razor:
  - The effect is not optional.
  - The hunt bonus applies to non-standard hunt actions, blood comes from the target of the hunt.
100004|Abactor:
  - '"Successful resolution" means the action must not be blocked and the vampire must have gained blood. If the vampire cannot
    gain blood (eg., {Vampiric Disease}, {Ex Nihilo}), the blood hunt is not called even if the action is not blocked.'
  - This is not a diablerie. Neither {Rebirth} nor {Carlton Van Wyk}'s ability can be used.
  - "The Blood Hunt referendum is still a Blood Hunt: {Lay Low} can be used, {Trophy: Diablerie} would prevent the referendum."
  - The Blood Hunt referendum is part of the action resolution. Cards that are played "after a successful action" or "after
    resolution" must be played after the referendum. {Heidelberg Castle, Germany} cannot be used before the referendum.
100005|Abandoning the Flesh:
  - Cannot be played when burned as a result of a Blood Hunt referendum.
  - Will not trigger the {Soul Gem of Etrius} since the vampire is removed from the game instead of being burned.
100006|Abbot:
  - The +1 intercept applies to actions directed at cards controlled by the controller. It does not apply to actions directed
    at other Methuselahs.
100007|Abjure:
  - Can be used by an incapacitated Imbued.
100008|Ablative Skin:
  - Cannot be used to prevent damage that cannot be prevented by cards that require Fortitude.
100009|Abombwe:
  - The requirements are ignored if the card is not played in the normal fashion (eg. diablerie or {Bima}).
100010|Abomination:
  - Can be played by burning a werewolf that has been recruited the same turn.
  - Is not a vampire in the ash heap (eg. {Possession} cannot be played on it).
  - If moved to the uncontrolled region (eg. by {Banishment}), it continues to be a vampire and can be influenced.
100011|Absimiliard's Army:
  - Putting the top card of your library in play as a ghoul does not count as playing the card.
  - The card used to represent the ally is face up, but the name on that card is ignored if something goes looking for a card
    by name. They do not contest.
  - A burned ghoul is removed from the game but is still burned first, triggering cards such as {Tension in the Ranks}.
  - Is not replaced until the condition is met, even if it is burned.
  - The "other Gehenna cards in play" requirement is only checked when playing the card.
  - Ghouls are monsters, not mortal.
100013|Absorb the Mind:
  - Can be played against a vampire with no blood.
100014|Abyssal Hunter:
  - Burns if ranged aggravated damage is inflicted on it at close range.
  - If he burns an ally with his action, this counts as a directed action burning an ally (eg. for Trophies).
100017|Achilles' Heel:
  - A vampire with no circle designation is in his own unique circle. Vampires with the same name (eg. {The Embrace}, non-unique
    vampires) do not share a circle by default, each has his own circle of one by default.
100018|Aching Beauty:
  - The pool loss occurs if the block would be successful, even if the action is ended (eg. {Change of Target} or {Obedience})
    or made unblockable ({Horrific Countenance}) at this point.
  - Burn pool effects are cumulative.
100023|Admonitions, The:
  - Cannot be used when a card is played, to draw a card that would cancel it "as it is played".
  - If you are the only Methuselah to control a Sabbat vampire, you keep control of The Admonitions each turn.
100024|Agate Talisman:
  - Can be equipped by a vampire with capacity less than 4, although they cannot lock it to get a vote.
100025|Agent of Power:
  - Is unique and provides a discipline even when it was not played in the normal fashion (eg. diablerie, {Deviki Prasanta},
    {Bima}).
  - If used as a placeholder to represent something else, its text does not apply (including the "Unique" part). A {Shock Troops}
    vampire would simply be a non-unique 1-cap Sabbat with no clan and no discipline.
  - If you play Agent of Power on a vampire and that vampire plays a {Dual Form} at superior , the Dual Form gains the Discipline
    provided by the Agent of Power and keeps it once the Agent of Power burns.
100027|Ahriman's Demesne:
  - The opponent does not go to torpor, {Undead Persistence} cannot be played.

  - The optional maneuver cannot be used if the strike cannot be used (eg. {Hidden Lurker}).
100033|Akhenaten, The Sun Pharaoh:
  - If it uses its last life to play an action modifier, the action fails. If it uses its last life to play a strike, combat
    ends before strike resolution.
  - If burned and shuffled into the library, other effects that apply when it is burned still apply (eg. {Set's Curse} puts
    an ally into play).
  - Is not shuffled into the library when it is discarded.
100034|Akunanse Kholo:
  - Cannot be used during a referendum that is automatically passing.
100038|Alastor:
  - If the weapon retrieved costs blood, that cost is paid by the vampire chosen by the vote.
  - Requirements do not apply. If a discipline is required (eg. {Inscription}) and the Alastor vampire does not have it, the
    inferior version is used.
100039|Alia, God's Messenger:
  - If it uses its last life to play an action modifier, the action fails. If it uses its last life to play a strike, combat
    ends before strike resolution.
100040|Alpha Glint:
  - Cards that are played at the end of round/combat can still be played (eg. {Taste of Vitae}, {Disarm}).
100042|Amam the Devourer:
  - The two actions provided are not cross-restrictive. Each can be performed once during the same turn by the same minion.
  - If burned and shuffled into the library, other effects that apply when it is burned still apply (eg. {Set's Curse} puts
    an ally into play).
  - Is not shuffled into the library when it is discarded.
100043|Amaranth:
  - If both minions want to play a card "when a vampire should go into torpor", the acting minion goes first. If played first,
    {Undead Persistence} would prevent the opponent to play {Amaranth} and vice-versa.
100044|Ambrosius, The Ferryman:
  - Immune means damage is not inflicted, even if non-preventable or outside combat.
100045|Ambulance:
  - If the action continues "as if unblocked", all action modifiers and reaction cards are still in effect, even those pertaining
    to a successful block.
  - If the action continues "as if unblocked", Methuselah that had declined to block before do not get another opportunity to
    block.
  - An action cannot continue "as if unblocked" after a combat resulting from a successful action (eg. {Bum's Rush}).
  - '"continue as if unblocked" moves the action card from the ash heap (where it went when the action was blocked) to limbo
    (where it should be if the action is not blocked). If the action card is not in the ash heap, then the action cannot be
    continued.'
100046|Ambush:
  - If the target unlocks and the action is not blocked, it is successful but has no effect.
100047|Amria:
  - The press can only be used during the current round.
100048|Amulet of Temporal Perception:
  - A second copy allows a second use in the same turn.

  - If it uses its last life to play an action modifier, the action fails. If it uses its last life to play a strike, combat

100052|Anarch Free Press, The:

  - Using it for the hunt bonus does not make the hunt an action "requiring an Anarch".
100055|Anarch Revolt:

  - Diablerie does not trigger Anathema.
  - Does not trigger if the vampire is burned by aggravated damage during damage resolution.
  - Damage done by combat effects after combat ends do not trigger Anathema.
  - Multiple Anathemas don't multiply the pool gain. Once one Anathema resolves it burns the vampire and the others are burned
    before they get to resolve.
  - It is controlled by the controller of the minion it's on - it is not removed when another Methuselah is ousted.
100063|Ancestor's Talisman, The:

100065|Ancilla Empowerment:

    Only the surviving ones get 6 pool from the oust of their prey (not of their grand-prey).
100066|Anesthetic Touch:
  - Does not end combat as a strike; it ends combat after strike resolution. It is still just a hand strike.
  - A dodge won't prevent combat from ending after strike resolution.

100111|Aura Absorption:

    played if the minion cannot afford to burn the blood.
100112|Aura of Invincibility:
  - If the initial referendum does not pass, then the card is not put into play and the vampire playing it is not sent to torpor.

  - Cannot be used during a referendum that is automatically passing.
100117|Autonomic Mastery:

  - A banished vampire can return to play when it again has blood >= capacity on it at the end of its Methuselah's influence
    phase.
  - A banished vampire will remember all effects that had been applied to them, just as contested vampires do. This includes
    gained or lost titles.

  - '"breaking any temporary control effects" means the vampire is placed in his last permanent controller''s uncontrolled region.'
  - If the vampire is permanently controlled by a Methuselah other than his owner, it goes to that Methuselah uncontrolled region
    and is still controlled by them. It is removed from the game if that Methuselah is ousted and kept in game if his owner

  - "{Change of Target} can be played after Bear-Baiting (younger, older, or the same age)."
  - If the combat is canceled, the action is still blocked, {Mask of a Thousand Faces} cannot be used to continue it, but an
    effect can be used to continue the action as if unblocked (eg. {Crypt's Sons}, {Momentary Delay}).
100146|Beast Meld:
  - The damage prevention can only be used if the block is successful, and only in the resulting (block-induced) combat. It
    does not carry over to a follow-up combat (eg.  {Psyche!}).

  - Cards and effects that are played "as the action is announced" must be played before playing "regular" action modifier or
    reaction cards.
  - Replace the action card (if any) before playing it.

100153|Bestial Vengeance:
  - Damage is environmental.
  - Bestial Vengeance's damage is inflicted whether or not the opposing minion's strike burns the retainer.
  - 'Damage is inflicted even against a dodge. A "strike: combat ends" ends combat before damage is applied, as will a combattant
    going to torpor during first strike.'
100156|Betrayer:
  - The affected Methuselah is named when the card is played.
  - Each of their turns, the person subjected to Betrayer can name a vampire. If the guess is correct, Betrayer is burned.
  - "Is cumulative: a player can be damaged by multiple Betrayers each turn. A Methuselah targeted by more than one Betrayer
    would have to pay 1 pool for each Betrayer in order to burn them, even if the same vampire is the betrayer in each case."
  - If the vampire chosen for Betrayer is burned, so is Betrayer. If the vampire chosen for Betrayer becomes contested, Betrayer
    is nullified until the contest is resolved, at which time the Betrayer is reactivated. If a player takes control of the
    vampire that is the target of the betrayer, that player takes the pool loss.

    but not {Compel the Spirit}).

201510|Zubeida:
  - Black Hand is not a title, it is a trait unrelated to any sect. The trait is not lost if the vampire changes sect.

  - The hunt bonus applies to non-standard hunt actions, blood comes from the target of the hunt. [RTR 20030519] [RTR 20180511]
G00007|Mention a Successful Hunt or Hunt Action:
  - A hunt is unsuccessful if no blood is gained, but the hunt action is successful as long as it is not blocked. [LSJ 20050720-2]
G00008|Do Not Unlock as Normal:
  - The "does not unlock as normal" effect is redundant with being infernal. If the minion is infernal, his controller can still pay a pool to unlock him. [LSJ 20050114]
